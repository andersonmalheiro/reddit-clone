# Reddit clone

This is a simple Reddit's clone made with Angular, aiming to learn it's fundamentals. It uses a REST API also made by me with Django that mimics some of the Reddit features. 

This is a unfinished project and some of the features are for visual purposes only.

# Running the project

This project needs the Angular CLI disponible on https://cli.angular.io/
